            Canderous Ordo was a Mandarlorian warrior of Clan Ordo during the era of the Old Republic. Ordo fought against the Galactic Republic in the Mandalorian Wars, and the war came to an end when the leader of the Mandalorians, Mandalore the Ultimate, was killed in single combat by the Jedi Knight Revan which ended the war. The Mandalorians were forced to surrender all of their weapons and armor in surrender. Revan also hid the mask of Mandalore the Ultimate, as whoever possessed the mask was the ruler of the Mandalorians. This led to a power scramble amongst the differt clans.

            After the war, Ordo served as a mercenary hired by the crime lord Davik Kang and eventually encountered Revan again. Bored of living life as a hired gun, Ordo decided to join Revan on his quest to find the superweapon known as the Star Forge which was under the command of the Sith Lord, and Revan's former apprentice, Darth Malak. Revan and Ordo were able to defeat Malak and destroy the Star Forge, and the two were honored by the Galactic Republic for their contributions to the galaxy.

            After the Star Forge was destroyed, Revan helped Ordo recover the mask of Mandalore the Ultimate. Once it was found, Ordo dawned the mask and declared himself Mandalore the Preserver and united the Mandalorian clans under his rule.
