            Meetra Surik was a Jedi Knight during the era of the Old Republic. Exiled from the Jedi Order after the events of the Mandalorian Wars, Surik was cut off from the Force.

            Eventually, she was found by Kreia. Kreia had also been exiled by the Jedi Order and founded a new Sith academy and took Sith Lords Darth Nihilus and Darth Sion as her apprentices. However, Kreia was betrayed by her apprentinces and exiled from her own academy. Having renounced the Sith, Kreia offered to teach Surik to defeat the Sith. Surik accepted Kreia's teaching and was able to kill the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus and was also able to convince Darth Sion to let go of his pain and allow himself to die.

            However, what Kreia did not tell Surik was that she was also planning a purge of the Jedi as she had lost faith in both the Jedi and the Sith orders. Upon discovering this, Surik and Kreia engaged in a duel in which Surik was victorious. Surik refused to kill Kreia, and Kreia showed her admiration for Surik claiming that she was a true Jedi before dying of her wounds.

            Sometime later, Surik set out to rescue her comrade, the Jedi Knight Revan, who had been captured by the Sith Empire. With the help of the Sith Lord Scourge, Surik was able to find and release Revan, and the three made their way to the throne room of the Sith Emperor. However, during the confrontation, Scourge double-crossed the Jedi and killed Surik by stabbing her in the back with his lightsaber. This turned the battle around and the Sith Emperor was able to defeat Revan and keep and imprison him. Revan was used as a source of life energy for the Sith Emperor to feed on, but Surik's spirit stayed by him, keeping him alive while he remained a prisoner for centuries.
