            Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith during the last remaining decades of the Galactic Republic. While a student of the Dark Side of the Force, Plagueis was also a man of science and combined his two areas of expertise in experiments to find a way to create and preserve life.

              While Plagueis believed that the Sith were destined to rule the galaxy, he did not agree with Darth Bane's Rule of Two, and he viewed his apprentice, Sheev Palpatine, as his equal rather than his student. Rather than take the galaxy by force, Plagueis and Palpatine decided to take a more meticulous approach.  The two Sith planned for Palpatine to use his political experience to his advantage and run for Supreme Chancellor of the Republic so that the Sith could eventually take control of the galaxy from within.

              However, after Palpatine was elected chancellor, he killed Plagueis in his sleep as he felt that his master was no longer of any use to him.
