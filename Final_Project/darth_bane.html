            Originally born as Dessel, Bane fled his homeworld and joined the Sith army to fight against the Galactic Republic in the New Sith Wars. Upon discovering that he was strong with the Force, he was sent to the Sith Academy on Korriban where he renamed himself "Bane".

              At his time at the academy, Bane felt that the current ways of the Sith were heavily flawed. Specifically, he felt that the number of Sith were far too many as they were all killing each other in attempts to attain power. Feeling that his leaders were holding the Sith back from their true potential to keep their own personal power, Bane studied the manuscripts of the ancient Sith and the holocron of Darth Revan. Based on what he had found in his studies, Bane convinced the entire Sith army to perform a ritual that, they believed, would defeat the Jedi and win them the war. However, the ritual ended up killing the entirety of the Sith except for Bane.

          <br>
          <p> Bane then created the Rule of Two which stated "Two there should be; no more, no less. One to embody the power, the other to crave it".  Darth Bane was eventually referred to as the Sith'ari, the prophesized one who would make the Sith stronger than ever before, and his concept that limited the number of Sith to two was used by the following Sith Lords for thousands of years.
