            Leia Organa was the leader of the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. A skilled diplomat and fierece combatant on the battlefield, Organa served as a symbol of hope throughout the galaxy.

          <p>
            During the war, she was captured by the Galactic Empire and held prisoner on the battle station the Death Star from which she witnessed the destruction of her homeworld Alderaan. She was later rescued by Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca. The four of them blasted their way past the Imperial stormtroopers and managed to escape. Organa brought the schematic plans of the Death Star to the Rebel Alliance and launched an attack on the battle station which ended in its destruction.

          <p>
            Near the end of the war, Organa learns that she is Skywalker's twin sister, and that he will teach her the ways of the Force. After the Empire fell and was reformed into the New Republc, she began her training with her brother. After the war, she also married Han Solo and the two had a son, Ben Solo who was strong with the Force like his mother.

          <br>
          <p>
            However, years later, Ben would turn to the Dark Side and become Kylo Ren and would become a key figure in forming the First Order from the ashes of the Empire.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Organa addressed the New Republic and claimed that they must fight the First Order or they will take over the galaxy, but her request was refused as they did not see the First Order as a real threat. This led to Organa forming her own army called the Resistance with her serving as its general. For the next year, she would be at war against her own son.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            During the war, Organa served as a symbol of hope for the Resistance and the galaxy, and she also began training Resistance member Rey, who was also strong with the Force, everything her brother taught her. As the war progressed, however, her health slowly began to deteriorate.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Near the end of the war, Organa's health took a turn for the worse, and she began to fear that her son was too far gone and would be lost to the Dark Side forever. On her deathbed, in a final attempt to bring him back to the Light, she reached out to him through the Force and called out his name before passing away.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Ben felt his mother's death, and it gave him the strength to see the error of his ways and turn away from Dark Side. Ben's return to the Light would lead to the downfall of the First Order and victory for the Resistance.
