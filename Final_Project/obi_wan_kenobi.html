            Obi-Wan Kenobi was a Jedi Knight during the era of the Galactic Republic. Ten years before the start of the Clone Wars, Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn encountered a young boy named Anakin Skywalker. Sensing how strong he was with the Force, Jinn intended on training him as his apprentice. However, after Jinn was killed on the planet Naboo by the Sith Lord Darth Maul, Kenobi promised his master that he would train the boy in his stead.

            Kenobi trained Skywalker as his apprentice and the two became like brothers. However, many years later at the end of the Clone Wars and the fall of the Galactic Republic, Skywalker had turned to the Dark Side, and Kenobi went to the volcanic planet Mustafar to confront him. Kenobi and Skywalker, now Darth Vader, engaged in a fierce duel and Kenobi severely injured his former student by cutting off his legs and helplessly watched as he fell to the bottom of the bank of a river of lava which caused him to catch fire. A tearful Kenobi left him for dead as his body was engulfed in flames.

            Kenobi then took Skywalker's infant son, Luke, to the planet Tatooine where the boy would live in hiding with his aunt and uncle. Kenobi secretly watched over the boy under the name "Ben Kenobi" and waited for when he would be ready to learn the ways of the Force.

            Years later, Kenobi was asked for help by leader of the Rebel Alliance, Leia Organa, to aid them in their fight against the Empire. He along with now grown up Luke and pilots Han Solo and Chewbecca venture to the Empire's battle station the Death Star to rescue Organa who was being held prisoner. On the Death Star, Kenobi encountered Vader once again who had now been placed in a cybernetic suit of armor due to his injuries years before. The two engaged in a duel, and Kenobi sacrificied himself to allow the others to escape.

            Althought Kenobi was killed by his former student, he was able to become one with the Force and his spirit was still able to guide Luke in his journey of becoming a Jedi.
