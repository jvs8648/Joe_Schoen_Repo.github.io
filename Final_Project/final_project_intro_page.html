          In 1977, audiences across the country, and the world, sat in awe and wonder as Star Wars: A New Hope played on the big screen. Not only was the movie a triumph of visual effects and production, but directory George Lucas was able to tell a story in a way that was never done before. The film became a pop culture phenomenon, and 8 more films were released throughout the decades as well as tv series and vieo games. The Star Wars series that has something for everyone to enjoy, and it tells the classic tale of good versus evil (Jedi v Sith, Light Side v Darth Side) and that hope and love can overcome all.

          The Star Wars series has one of the biggest and most diverse fanbase in the world with countless fans creating character cosplays as well as taking the films as inspirations to create their own projects. As the franchise became more and more popular, the story of the galaxy far far away was expanded far beyond the events that occured before and after the films giving it a extemely vast extended universe. Once Disney bought the rights to Star Wars for a whopping four billion dollars back in 2012, many of the events from the extended universe were removed from the Star Wars canon, what is recognized as what officially happens in the story. Two lists were then created, one being a list of characters and events recognized as canon and the other a list of characters and events recognized as noncanon (also referred to as "Legends"). Despite many aspects of Star Wars lore being deemed noncanon, the characters and events, both canon and Legends, hold a special place within the fans' hearts.
