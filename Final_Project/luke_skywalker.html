            Luke Skywalker was a Jedi Knight and a key figure in the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. Skywalker had grown up a moisture farmer on the planet Tatooine with his aunt and uncle who refused to talk about his father's past. However, Skywalker would learn from the hermit Ben Kenobi that his father was a Jedi Knight in the days of the Galactic Republic, and that he was killed by Darth Vader. Kenobi also revealed that he too was a Jedi Knight and that Skywalker's father had been his apprentice and offered to teach him the ways of the Force. Skywalker agreed to begin training under the mentoring of Kenobi, and they along with pilots Han Solo and Chewbacca embarked for the planet Alderaan after Kenobi's help was requested by Leia Organa, the leader of the Rebel Alliance.

          <br>
          <p>
            Upon arrival, however, they had discovered that Alderaan had been destroyed by the Empire's battle station the Death Star. Upon learning that Organa was also being held captive aboard the Death Star, they infiltrated the battle station and rescued her. While Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca were attempting to rescue Organa, Kenobi encountered Vader and the two engaged in a duel. Kenobi sacrificed himself to allow the others to escape.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Organa was able to deliver the schematic plans of the Death Star to the Rebel Alliance and orchestrated a starship assault on the battle station. Skywalker offered his assistance, as he was a skilled pilot back on Tatooine, and was given a place in the squadron of X-Wing starfighters.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The attacked on the Death Star commenced, and Skywalker fired two proton torpedoes into the station's exhaust port resulting in its destruction.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Sometime after the Death Star's destruction, Skywalker received a vision from Kenobi's ghost which told him he must go to the swamp planet Dagobah and find the Jedi named Yoda who would complete his training. Skywalker followed Kenobi's instructions and found Yoda who agreed to train him. During his training, Skywalker experienced a vision of his friends being captured and tortured by the Empire in Cloud City on the planet Bespin. Believing this to be a sign, Luke left for Bespin to rescue his friends despite Yoda and Kenobi insisting that he stay and complete his training.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Upon arriving on Bespin, Skywalker realized that it was a trap, and the vision he saw was a ploy to bring him to Cloud City with Vader waiting for him. The two engaged in a duel, with Vader testing him to see how much he had learned. Ultimately, Vader defeated him by cutting off his hand. Vader then revealed to Skywalker that he did not kill his father, as Kenobi had told him, but he was his father. Vader tried to convince a horrified Skywalker to join him and they coudl rule the galaxy as father and son, but Skywalker managed to escape.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            A year later, Skywalker was captured again by Vader and was brought to Emperor Palpatine in an attempt to turn him to the Dark Side. In the emperor's throne room, Skywalker and Vader engaged in a duel once again. This time, Skywalker was able to defeat Vader by cutting off his hand. However, after refusing to kill his father, Palpatine attempts to murder Skywalker with force lightning. Seeing that his son was dying, Vader came to the aid of Skywalker by seizing Palpatine and throwing him down a reactor shaft to his death. Vader died moments later in his son's arms after finally being able to look at him with his own eyes.

          <p>
            After the fall of the Empire, Skywalker dedicated himself to rebuilding the Jedi Order and started a training academy for force-sensitive individuals, one of which being his nephew Ben Solo. However, during his training, Skywalker sensed a growing darkness in Ben and decided to search his mind when he slept. When he looked into Ben's mind, Skywalker realized that his nephew's heart had been turned to the Dark Side. For a bried moment fueled by insticnt alone, Skywalker believed he could stop Ben from wreaking havoc on the galaxy and ignited his lightsaber to kill him. His instict had fled as quick as it came, and Skywalker stood frozen looking at his frightened nephew.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Realizing what was happening, an enraged Ben pulled his hut down upon both of them knocking Skywalker unconscious. Ben went on to destroy Skywalker's academy and kill most of his students.
          </p>
          <br>
          Skywalker secluded in himself in shame on the planet Anch To and planned on staying there until he died. During the First-Order-Resistance War, Skywalker was found by Resistance member Rey who was sent to attempt to convince Skywalker to aid them in their fight against the First Order. After refusing vehemently, a disappointed Rey left Anch To and returned to the Resistance.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          However, later in the war, the Resistance was about to be destroyed by the First Order led by Ben Solo (now Kylo Ren). However, as the First Order approached, Skywalker projected himself with the Force in front of Ben and distracted him so that the Resistance could escape. Once the Resistance had escaped, Skywalker's apparition disappeared in front of Ben leaving him humiliated and enraged. However, the effort of maintaining his projection was too great, and Skywalker passed away on Anch To, becoming one with the Force.
