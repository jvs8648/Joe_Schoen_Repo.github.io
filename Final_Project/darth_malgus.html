            Darth Malgus was a Dark Lord of the Sith during the era of the Old Republic. Orignally born as Verdun, it was discovered at an early age that he was strong with the Force and was sent to the Sith Academy on the planet Dromund Kaas where he later renamed himself "Darth Malgus".

            At the academy, Malgus trained to become a powerful Sith Lord. He beleived that he was destined to destroy the Jedi, and he even killed his own master in disgust after seeing him defeated by a Jedi Knight in combat. Malgus also became a skilled commander of the Imperial Army in the fight against the Jedi and the Galactic Republic during the Great Galactic War. During the peak of the war, Malgus led his army in an attack of the Republic captial world of Coruscant bringing destruction onto the city and destroying the Jedi Temple in the process.
