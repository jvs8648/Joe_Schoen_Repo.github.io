            Ahsoka Tano was a Jedi Knight during the Clone Wars. Sent by Master Yoda himself, Tano met Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi on the planet Christophsis and became the former's apprentice.

            The two had a rocky start, but Skywalker and Tano became very close, developing a sibling-like bond as Skywalker taught her all he knew about the ways of the Jedi and the Force.

            Later on in the Clone Wars, the Jedi Temple was bombed and Tano was framed as the one responsible. She was held on trial by the Jedi Council and was about to be sentenced to death before she was acquitted of her charges based on evidence presented by Skywalker. Tano was proven innocent, but had lost her faith in the Jedi Council after them assuming she was guilty from the start. Ultimately Tano decided to leave the Jedi Order despite her master's pleas for her to stay.

            Near the end of the Clone Wars, Tano, who at this point had renounced her Jedi title and was living as an ordinary citizen, was approached by Mandalorian warrior Bo-Katan Kryze to ask for her asistance in freeing her planet Mandalore which had been conquered by Darth Maul. Not knowing where else to turn, Tano contacted her former master for help and she was given command of a section of a division of the clone troopers, the soldiers of the Republic, the 501st Legion.

            Tano and her section the 501st came to the aid of Mandalore and she was able to defeat and capture Maul. However, on route back to the Republic captial planet Coruscant, Chancellor Palpatine issued Order 66 which ordered the clone troopers to kill their own Jedi commanders. Tano was able to escape the clones and went into hiding as the Republic was transformed into the Galactic Empire.

            Many years later, Tano met Skywalker (now Darth Vader) once again. After Vader claimed that the man he used to be, Anakin Skywalker, was weak and he destroyed him. Outraged at what her master had become, Tano attacked Vader and the two engaged in a very emotionaly tense duel. The duel was paused when Ahsoka damaged Vader's mask and he called out her name in Anakin's own voice. In an attempt to bring him back to the Light Side, she promised him that she wouldn't leave him again (referring to when she left the Jedi Order). After a long period of silence, Vader stated that she would die and charged her once more. They engaged in combat once again and Tano was eventually able to escape.

            Years later, after the fall of the Empire, an older Tano helped Mandalorian Din Djarin in his quest to find a force-sensitive child named Grogu a master to teach him the ways of the Force.
