            Anakin Skywalker was a Jedi Knight during the period of the Clone Wars. With such a strong connection to the Force, it was believed that Skywalker was the Chosen One, the prophesized Jedi that would destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Skywalker proved to be a powerful Jedi Knight and a skilled commander that brought many victories to the Republic during the Clone Wars alongside his master Obi-Wan Kenobi and apprentice Ahsoka Tano.

            However, at the end of the Clone Wars, Anakin was troubled by visions of his wife, Padmé Amidala, dying in childbirth. Desparate to prevent these visions from coning true, Skywalker was convinced by Chancellor Palpatine (secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious) to turn to the Dark Side and become his apprentice, and he would have the power to save Padmé from certain death.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Skywalker, now Darth Vader, and Palpatine then orchestrated the downfall of the Jedi Order branding the Jedi Knights as traitors to the Republic and all Jedi would be executed. Palpatine also claimed that the Republic would be transformed into the Galactic Empire with him serving as its emperor.

            During this Jedi purge, Vader encountered his now former master Obi-Wan Kenobi on the volcanic planet Mustafar. The two engaged in a fierce duel, and Kenobi defeated his former student by cutting off his legs leaving him helpless at the bank of a river of lava. Due to his proximity to the lava, Vader caught fire, and a tearful Kenobi left him for dead as his body was engulfed in flames.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Vader's charred, mangled body was found by Palpatine and he took him back to the Empire's capital planet Coruscant where he was placed in a cybernetic suit of armor to keep him alive.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Years later, Vader and Kenobi would meet again on the Empire's battle station the Death Star and the two duelled once more. This time, Vader was victorious and killed his former master. Some time after, Vader discovered he had a son, Luke Skywalker, and brought him to his master Emperor Palpatine to turn him to the Dark Side. Vader and Luke engaged in a duel in the Emperor's throne room and Luke defeated him in combat, but Palpatine attacked Luke with force lightning after he refused to kill his father. Hearing his son's plea for help, Vader seized his master and threw him down a reactor shaft to his death, turning back to the Light Side and reborn again as Anakin Skywalker.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            After killing Palpatine, Skywalker asked Luke to remove his helmet for him so he could look at his son with his own eyes. Luke complied and removed his father's helmet which revealed a tired, broken old man. Skywalker told his son that he had saved him and, soon after, Skywalker died in his son's arms.
