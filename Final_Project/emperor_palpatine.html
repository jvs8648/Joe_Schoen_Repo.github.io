            Emperor Palpatine was a Dark Lord of the Sith and ruler of the Galactic Empire. Secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, Palpatine rose to power when he was elected Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic with help from his master Darth Plagueis. Palpatine then killed Plagueis after he was elected as he saw that his master was no longer of any use to him

            During the Clone Wars Palpatine had three apprentices, Darth Maul (who had presumably died on Naboo), Count Dooku (who was killed by Anakin Skywalker), and Anakin Skywalker. Seeing that Skywalker was a very powerful Jedi, Palpatine saw him as a powerful tool to bring the destruction of the Jedi Order. He convinced Skywalker to turn to the Dark Side under his apprenticeship by telling him that he had to power to save his wife, Padm√©, from certain death.

            Palpatine issued Order 66 which deemed the Jedi as traitors and commanded the clone troopers, the soldiers of the Galactic Republic, to kill them. Palpatine then declared that the Republic would be reorganized into the Galactic Empire with him leading as its emperor. From that point, Palpatine and Skywalker (now Darth Vader) ruled the galaxy through fear.

            Near the end of the Empire's reign, Vader had brought his son Luke Skywalker to the Palpatine to attempt to turn him to the Dark Side. After seeing Luke defeat his father in combat but refuse to kill him, Palpatine attempted to kill Luke with force lightning but was seized by Vader and thrown down a reactor shaft to his death.

            Sometime after, Palpatine was resurrected from the dead by the Sith Eternal cult using cloning technology and dark rituals on the planet Exegol. Palpatine and the cult attempted to reclaim the galaxy, but he was defeated by the Jedi Rey.
