                I found the reading "The Medium is the Massage" by Marshall McLuhan to be very interesting.  In the reading, the author describes the concept that the reason a message has an effect on something is not because of the message itself, but how the public interacts with the medium in which the message is presented.  McLuhan then describes that media can be manipulated so that the public can be soothed by its message because of how it is presented by its medium, hence the title "The Medium is the Massage".  This reading presented a very interesting concept, and it was very surprising to see how accurate this concept was in terms of how media is presented and handled today considering when this book was written.
