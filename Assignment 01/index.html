          The reading Long Live the Internet Tim Berners-Lee was both very interesting as well as concerning.  Tim-Berners-Lee explains the disastrous consequences of organizations gaining control of how the web operates will bring to its users.  The most dire consequence being restriction of access to the web.  This is concerning because restriction of access to the internet would be universally disadvantageous to all of its users.  An interesting point Berners-Lee makes in the reading, however, is his proposal of separating the web from the internet.  Berners-Lee claims that not only can both the web and the internet function independently from each other, but their separation is imperative for innovation.  I believe that this is a very interesting concept and could potentially be successful in bringing innovation as shown by Berners-Lee’s statement of how the internet has been able to improve drastically, but the web has had to be manually redesigned when connected to the internet.

          The reading As We May Think was a very interesting article which made me think about how the human mind attempts to create innovations.  In the reading, author Vannevar Bush explains how innovations that are created that seem completely new and original are usually inspired from an invention that already exists.  Bush also predicts the invention of what is now called the internet, which he called the memex machine, that was derived from already existing technologies at the time Bush’s essay was written (which was in 1945).  After reading this passage, I began to look at the way new advancements in technology are made and how they are made based on already existing technologies from their time.
