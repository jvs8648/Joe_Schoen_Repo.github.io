            Darth Maul was a Dark Lord of the Sith during the Clone Wars. An apprentice to Darth Sidious, Maul used his rage and anger to his advantage to overwhelm his opponents.

          <p>
            On the planet Naboo, the Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi encountered the Sith Lord and engaged in a fierce duel (where Maul also debuted his double-bladed lightsaber which blew everyone in 1999's minds). Maul was able to kill Jinn, but was presumably killed when Kenobi cut him in half and fell down a reactor shaft.

            However, Maul survived and managed to escape to a barren planet Lothor Minor where he went insane. He was found years later by his brother Savage Oppress and was brought back to his homeworld of Dathomir where he obtained mechanical legs and regained his memories and sanity in a ritual performed by Mother Talzin.

          <p> Maul then dedicated himself to exact revenge on his mortal enemy Obi-Wan Kenobi for what he had done to him on Naboo and the two met and duelled on several occasions.

            Near the end of the Clone Wars, Maul had raised a powerful army and had conquered the planet of Mandalore, and he attempted to lure Kenobi and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker to him. Maul had sensed his former master Darth Sidious' plan to destroy the Jedi order, and Skywalker was a major part of that plan in some way. Maul hoped that he would come to Mandalore to stop his seige so that Maul could kill him and halt Sidious' plans. He was surprised to see that Skywalker's apprentice Ahsoka Tano came in his stead. He tried to convince her to join him in his attempt to stop Sidious but was refused when he questioned Skywalker's loyalty to the Jedi. Ahsoka defeated and captured Maul after an intense duel, but Maul was able to escape after their ship had crashed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Years after the fall of the Republic, Maul set out to find Kenobi one last time and discovered that he was in hiding from the Galactic Empire on the planet Tatooine. Now old men, Kenobi and Maul engaged in a final duel in which Kenobi quickly cut Maul down. Finding peace, Maul died in the arms of his enemy.
