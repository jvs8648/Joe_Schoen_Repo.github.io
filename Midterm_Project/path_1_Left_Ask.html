        As the two of you exit the woods, you apologize to your friend for running away from him when he found you.  Confused, he tells you that you didn't run away from him, and he found you hiding behind a tree.  Your stomach sinks at his response.  Against better judgment, you take one last look at the woods behind you.  You quickly realize that it would have been better if you hadn't.
