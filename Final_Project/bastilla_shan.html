            Bastila Shan was a Jedi Knight during the era of the Old Republic. During a period of conflict known as the Jedi Civil War, Shan was sent to find and capture a Jedi who had turned to the Dark Side who was now known as Darth Revan. Shan was able to capture Revan and return him the Jedi, and she and the Jedi Council devised a plan to wipe Revan's memories and retrain him in the ways of the Jedi. Shan personally oversaw Revan's training as well as the restructuring of his mind in the hopes that she would discover the location of the superweapon the Star Forge, which was under the command of Revan and his former apprentice Darth Malak. Despite turning to the Dark Side in the past, the reborn Revan remained faithful to the Jedi Code.

            Eventually, Revan and Shan were able to discover the location of the Star Forge, but Shan was captured by Malak and was turned to the Dark Side. Revan boarded the Star Forge to confront Shan, and he was able to turn her back to the Light. Shan then helped Revan and the Republic in the ongoing battle, and they were able to defeat Darth Malak and destroy the Star Forge.
