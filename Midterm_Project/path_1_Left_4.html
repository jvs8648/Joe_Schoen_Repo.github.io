        The horrid sounds and dancing creatures that have tormented you have now gone and left you with an unbearable silence.  Within the silence, you think you hear the distant sound of someone breathing.  You close your eyes tightly and try to regain compsure, thinking your nerves are still getting the better of you.  As the sound grows louder, you realize that the dreadful gasping is all too real.
