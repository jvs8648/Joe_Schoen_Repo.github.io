        You slowly make your way to your assailant who remains motionless on the ground.  With your heart beating in your ears, you roll the figure on its back with your shovel.  You reel back in horror as you realize your "assailant" was actually your friend trying to find you.  Realizing what you've done, you drop the shovel and run aimlessly into the woods leaving your friend behind still motionless on the ground.
