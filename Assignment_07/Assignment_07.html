        This reading was a little hard to follow, but I found the concept that I believe the author was trying to convey very interesting.  I believe the concept the author was trying to convey was that people were able to interpret their identity with individual pieces of technology, but find it impossible to do that with online media platforms.  This is mentioned in the textwhen the author explains how when someone owns a car, they interpret their identity with this car (with the example given being the car being the vessel for its brain, the driver).  With the interaction being simply with the user and the technology, the user has a good sense of what they want.  However, on social media, it is very hard for the user cannot determine what they want due to the vast amount of users trying to do the same thing.  This is a very interesting concept, especially considering the toxic environment on social media.
