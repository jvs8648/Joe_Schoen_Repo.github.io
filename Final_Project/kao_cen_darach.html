            Kao Cen Darach was a Jedi Knight during the era of the Old Republic.

            Just before the outbreak of the Great Galactic War, Darach and his apprentice Satele Shan were assigned a post at a security station which orbited the planet Korriban. While on duty, the army of the Sith Empire attacked the station, revealing themselves for the first time in centuries. Darach deduced that he had to warn the Republic of the Sith's return, and he, Shan, smuggler Nico Okarr, and Republic Army Corporal Jace Malcom made their way for Okarr's starship as it was the only one not destroyed from the attack. They're progress was halted, however, by the Sith Lord Vindican and his apprentice Malgus.  Darach and Shan engaged the Sith in a fierce duel while Okarr and Malcom brought the ship online. Once the ship was operational Darach told his apprentice to board the ship and escape while he stayed behind. Shan followed her master's command, but not before throwing him her double bladed lightsaber.

            Darach, now weilding both his and Shan's lightsabers, fought off both of the Sith at once while Okarr, Malcom, and Shan escaped the station. In their confrontation, Darach was able to fatally wound Vindican. However, Malgus, enraged at his master's defeat, overwhelmed Darach with both his and Vindican's lightsabers and cut the Jedi down.
