            Darth Nihilus was a Dark Lord of the Sith during the era of the Old Republic.  Becoming an embodiment of a wound in the Force, Nihilus was forced to absorb the life force of living things in order to sustain himself, and, as he consumed, more life was required to keep him alive.

            Eventually, Nihilus was forced to encase his soul into his armor and mask as the process of absorbing life had caused his own body to deterioate.  Darth Nihilus, having also given himself the name "Lord of Hunger", became one of the most dominating forces in the galaxy as he was now able to absorb the life force of entire planets.  Eventually, the Dark Lord met his end when he was killed on his ship by Jedi Knight Meetra Surik.
