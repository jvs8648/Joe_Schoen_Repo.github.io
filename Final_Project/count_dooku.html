            Count Dooku was a Dark Lord of the Sith and the leader of the Separatist Alliance during the Clone Wars. Originally a Jedi Knight and a student of Master Yoda, Dooku saw flaws within the Jedi Order and turned to the Dark Side of the Force under the mentoring of Darth Sidious (Chancellor Palpatine).

            Dooku (now Darth Tyrannus) became the leader of the Separatist Alliance, a faction of planets that seceded from the rule of the Galactic Republic, during a period of conflict known as the Clone Wars.

            Dooku was a formidable foe the Jedi during the Clone Wars. The most skilled duelist in the galaxy, Dooku was able to make short work of even the most powerful Jedi Knights such as Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi (with Dooku cutting off Skywalker's right arm and nearly killing Kenobi).
          </p>

            Near the end of the Clone Wars, Dooku and the leader of the Separatist army General Grevious orchestrated an attack on the Republic captial planet Coruscant and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine. Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi were sent to rescue the chancellor. The Jedi encountered Dooku and the three duelled once more. Dooku was able to incapacitate Kenobi, but was eventually killed by Skywalker.
