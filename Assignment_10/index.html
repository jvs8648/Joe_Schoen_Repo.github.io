            The Javascript Library that I used for this assignment was Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a library that makes it easy to design your HTML document with stylesheets, framework, and Javascript plug-ins. There are many ways that Bootstrap can improve the overall design of your document, and two aspects of this library I used in this document are Bootstrap's "page-header" and "jumbotron" functions.  When you download Bootstrap(or insert its CDN) you then go to your HTML body and make a div class called "container" or "container-fluid" which will create padding around the contents of the div. Within that div create another div class called "page-header". The page-header function will automatically enlarge and underline whatever text you input. This function works very well if you're making a header/subheader. Another function you can use, within the "container" div, is called the "jumbotron" function. To use this, simply create another div class and call it "jumbotron". This function will enlarge your text and encase it in a box like the one you're reading right now!

            There are many things you can do with Bootstrap to improve your document so it was a little confusing when I first started to learn how to use it. Once I learned the basics of how Bootstrap works, it became easier to implement its functions to my document, and I began to appreciate how effective and useful the library is.
