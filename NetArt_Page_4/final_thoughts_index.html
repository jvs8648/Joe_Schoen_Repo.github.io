      This was a very interesting NetArt piece to interact with.  While we both saw diffent pieces, we both felt the same emotions while interacting with this website.  We both felt that the pieces were very abstract and almost cryptic.  It was also very interesting to interact with the database and learn about many latinx netartists and their pieces.
