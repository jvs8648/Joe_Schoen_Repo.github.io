            Darth Vader was a Dark Lord of the Sith during the time of the Galactic Empire. Formerly Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Vader turned to the Dark Side at the end of the Clone Wars and helped to destroy the Jedi order. Injuries he sustained at the hands of his former master Obi-Wan Kenobi on the planet Mustafar forced him to be placed in a cybernetic suit of armor that greatly hindered his abilities.

            However, even with the suits limitations, Vader was still the most dominant force in the galaxy, and he did not hesistate to kill Jedi Knights, rebels, or subordinates who failed him.

            After the duel on Mustafar years before, Vader and Kenobi met again on the Empire's superweapon the Death Star where Vader killed his former master. After the Death Star's destruction, Vader discovered that he had a son, Luke Skywalker, and brought him to his master, Emperor Palpatine, in an attempt to turn him to the Dark Side of the Force. Luke and Vader engaged in a duel in the emperor's throne room, and Vader discovered that he also had a daughter, Leia Organa. When Vader claimed that he would turn her to the Dark Side if Luke did not, Luke attacked with verocity and cut off Vader's hand.

            Afterwards, however, Palpatine attepted to kill Luke with force lightning after he refused to kill his father. Hearing his son's pleas for help, Vader turned back to the light seizing Palpatine and threw him down a reactor shaft to his death.

            His suit now failing, Luke dragged Vader's dying body to a nearby shuttle where he asked Luke to remove his mask so that he could see his son with his own eyes. After doing so, Vader told Luke to leave him behind as Luke had already saved him. Moments later, Vader died in his son's arms.
