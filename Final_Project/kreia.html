          -Confrontation between Darth Sion and Kreia

            Kreia was a Jedi Knight during the era of the Old Republic. With the views that went against those of the Jedi Council, Kreia was exiled from the Jedi Order and she went on to form a new order of Jedi.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In her attempt to fully understand the Force, however, Kreia succumbed to Dark Side becoming a Sith Lord. Kreia, who at this point renamed herself Darth Traya, formed the Trayus Academy to form a new order of the Sith. Kreia also recruited the Sith Lords Darth Nihilus and Darth Sion as her personal apprentices.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            However, Traya was betrayaed by her apprentices, and lost her ability to use the Force as Nihilus absorbed her powers.  The two Sith exiled their former master from her own academy.
          </p>
          <p>
          Traya renounced her Sith name, returning to Kreia, sought out Jedi Knight Meetra Surik (who had also been exiled from the Jedi Order). Kreia served as Surik's mentor and prepared her to defeat the Sith. While training her, Kreia was simultaneously plotting a purge of the Jedi as she had lost faith in both orders.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Once Surik learned of her master's true intentions, the two engaged in an intense duel with Surik emerging victorious. However, despite Kreia's demands to let her die, Surik refused to kill her. Kreia showed her admiration for Surik, claiming that she was a true Jedi for showing mercy to a fallen opponent, before passing away from her injuries.
